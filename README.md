# Compressor and Decompressor Project

## Introduction
Welcome to the Compressor and Decompressor project developed in Java. This project aims to reduce the size of files through compression techniques while ensuring data integrity. The primary objective is to save storage space, speed up file transfers, and reduce costs associated with storage hardware and network bandwidth.

## Objectives
- Implement compression techniques to reduce file sizes.
- Develop a decompression mechanism to restore compressed files to their original form.
- Utilize Java and Java Swing for building the application's logic and user interface.
- Ensure lossless conversion to prevent data loss during compression and decompression processes.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: Programming language for implementing compression and decompression algorithms.
- **Java Swing**: GUI toolkit for creating the application's graphical user interface.
- **Java IO Package**: Handles input and output streams for file operations.
- **JFrame**: Represents the main window of the application for user interaction.

## Building Basic UI and Logic
1. **Project Setup**: Created a Java application named "Compressor Decompressor" using Netbeans with Maven.
2. **GUI Development**: Designed the basic layout using Java Swing and JFrame.
3. **ActionListener Implementation**: Implemented ActionListener to handle user interactions with buttons.
4. **Button Functionality**: Added Compress and Decompress buttons with corresponding actions.
5. **Default Close Operation**: Set the default close operation for proper termination.

## Writing Logic
1. **Package Creation**: Created a package named "comp_decomp" to organize compressor and decompressor classes.
2. **Logic Implementation**: Implemented compression and decompression algorithms in respective classes.
3. **File Handling**: Used input and output streams for reading and writing file data.
4. **File Chooser Integration**: Incorporated file chooser for selecting files to compress or decompress.
5. **Output File Management**: Saved compressed/decompressed files in the same directory.

## Final Part
1. **Layout and UI Design**: Completed the layout and UI design for better user experience.
2. **Business Logic Integration**: Integrated compression and decompression algorithms into the application.
3. **ActionListener Implementation**: Implemented ActionListener to handle user actions.
4. **File Chooser Integration**: Integrated file chooser functionality for file selection and saving.
5. **Documentation**: Refer to the project documentation for detailed information.
